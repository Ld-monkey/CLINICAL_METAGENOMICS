Removing output files of failed job rm_poor_quality_and_duplicate since they might be corrupted:
results/trimmed_reads/trimmed_samples_reads_04_06_2020/
Skipped removing non-empty directory results/trimmed_reads/trimmed_samples_reads_04_06_2020/
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
