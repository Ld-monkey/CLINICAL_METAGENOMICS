Run classify a set of sequences with kraken 2
In the sequence : /data1/scratch/masalm/Valid_Mg_Groute/190710-Nextseq-bact/FASTQ/10-SIA-PLA-ADN_S10_R1.fastq
The prefix name file is : 10-SIA-PLA-ADN_S10_
The suffix name file is : .fastq
So the name of his paired file is : 10-SIA-PLA-ADN_S10_R2.fastq
In the sequence : /data1/scratch/masalm/Valid_Mg_Groute/190710-Nextseq-bact/FASTQ/1-MAR-LBA-ADN_S1_R1.fastq
The prefix name file is : 1-MAR-LBA-ADN_S1_
The suffix name file is : .fastq
So the name of his paired file is : 1-MAR-LBA-ADN_S1_R2.fastq
In the sequence : /data1/scratch/masalm/Valid_Mg_Groute/190710-Nextseq-bact/FASTQ/2-SCH-LBA-ADN_S2_R1.fastq
The prefix name file is : 2-SCH-LBA-ADN_S2_
The suffix name file is : .fastq
So the name of his paired file is : 2-SCH-LBA-ADN_S2_R2.fastq
In the sequence : /data1/scratch/masalm/Valid_Mg_Groute/190710-Nextseq-bact/FASTQ/3-DAS-LBA-ADN_S3_R1.fastq
The prefix name file is : 3-DAS-LBA-ADN_S3_
The suffix name file is : .fastq
So the name of his paired file is : 3-DAS-LBA-ADN_S3_R2.fastq
In the sequence : /data1/scratch/masalm/Valid_Mg_Groute/190710-Nextseq-bact/FASTQ/4-PAV-LBA-ADN_S4_R1.fastq
The prefix name file is : 4-PAV-LBA-ADN_S4_
The suffix name file is : .fastq
So the name of his paired file is : 4-PAV-LBA-ADN_S4_R2.fastq
